   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-eks-cluster-awscli.git
   cd aws-eks-cluster-awscli
   ```

2. **Set up upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mea37065/aws-eks-cluster-awscli.git
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install shellcheck for script linting
   sudo apt-get install shellcheck  # Ubuntu/Debian
   brew install shellcheck          # macOS
   
   # Install additional tools
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   # Test basic functionality
   ./scripts/create-vpc.sh --help
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   kubectl version --client
   ```

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- **Follow existing code style** and conventions
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Update documentation** as needed
- **Include error handling** and validation
- **Test in multiple environments** when possible

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Lint shell scripts
shellcheck scripts/*.sh

# Test basic functionality
./scripts/create-vpc.sh --dry-run
./scripts/create-eks.sh --validate

# Test cleanup procedures
./scripts/destroy-eks.sh --verify
./scripts/delete-vpc.sh --confirm
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add multi-region support for EKS deployment

- Implement cross-region VPC peering
- Add Route 53 health checks for failover
- Update documentation with multi-region examples
- Include cost analysis for multi-region setup

Resolves #7"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request on GitHub
gh pr create --title "feat: add multi-region support" --body "Description of changes..."
```
